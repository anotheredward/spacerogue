No one works out they can lazer

Hanging off platforms is confusing
	repace invisible hanging off platforms with visible .s
	remove commas from large jump gaps to encourage jumping

Alerts interrupt the flow of the game, forcing users to use the mouse
	Replace alerts with counter in parts legend

Space-walk is confusing
	Design levels so it's quite hard to fall off the map

Floating off the map isn't fun
	Can't steps off railings straight off the edge of the map
	Can throw yourself from far away

Hard to tell when you're in space walk mode
	Jet noise and music cues help

Random part locations are breaking the level design
	Remove random part systems
	Replace with manually placing parts

Goblins overwhelm players
	introduce goblins later

ALERTS SUCK FOR FREQUENT EVENTS!
